//! Visits on graphs.
//!
//! Implementation of [sequential](Sequential) and [parallel][Parallel] visits
//! depend on a type parameter `A` implementing the trait [`Event`]; they
//! provide visit methods accepting a callback function with argument `A` and
//! returning a `ControlFlow<E, ()>`, where `E` is a type parameter of the visit
//! method: for example, `E` might be [`StoppedWhenDone`] when completing early,
//! [`Interrupted`] when interrupted or [`Infallible`](std::convert::Infallible)
//! if the visit cannot be interrupted.
//!
//! If a callback returns a [`Break`](ControlFlow::Break), the visit will be
//! interrupted, and the [`Break`](ControlFlow::Break) value will be the return
//! value of the visit method; for uninterruptible visits we suggest to use the
//! [`no-break`](https://crates.io/crates/no-break) crate and its
//! [`continue_value_no_break`](no_break::NoBreak::continue_value_no_break)
//! method on the result to let type inference run smoothly.
//!
//! Note that an interruption does not necessarily denote an error condition
//! (see, e.g., [`StoppedWhenDone`]).
//!
//! [Sequential visits](Sequential) are visits that are executed in a single
//! thread, whereas [parallel visits](Parallel) use multiple threads. The
//! signature of callbacks reflects this difference ([`FnMut`] for the
//! sequential case vs. [`Fn`] + [`Sync`] for the parallel case).
//!
//! In case of interruption sequential visits usually return immediately to the
//! caller, whereas in general parallel visits might need to complete part of
//! their subtasks before returning to the caller.
//!
//! Additionally, implementations might accepts a filter function accepting a
//! [`Event::FilterArgs`] that will be called when a new node is discovered. If
//! the filter returns false, the node will be ignored, that is, not even marked
//! as known. Note that in case of parallel visits the filter might be called
//! multiple times on the same node (and with a different predecessor, if
//! available) due to race conditions.
//!
//! All visits have also methods accepting an `init` item similarly to the
//! [Rayon](rayon) [`map_with`](rayon::iter::ParallelIterator::map_with) method.
//! For parallel visits, the item will be cloned.
//!
//! There is a blanket implementation of the [`Parallel`] trait for all types
//! implementing the [`Sequential`] trait. This approach makes it possible to
//! have structures that can use both sequential and parallel visits.
//!
//! Visit must provide a `reset` method that makes it possible to reuse the
//! visit.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! There are examples of visits in
//! [`SeqIter`](crate::visits::depth_first::SeqIter),
//! [`ParFair`](crate::visits::breadth_first::ParFair) and
//! [`ParLowMem`](crate::visits::breadth_first::ParLowMem).
