/// Granularity of parallel tasks, specified transparently by nodes or arcs.
///
/// This enum provides a way to specify the granularity of parallel tasks on
/// graphs. It is used by
/// [`par_apply`](crate::traits::SequentialLabeling::par_apply) and
/// [`par_node_apply`](crate::traits::SequentialLabeling::par_node_apply).
///
/// Some parallel implementations (e.g.,
/// [`par_node_apply`](crate::traits::SequentialLabeling::par_node_apply))
/// express naturally the granularity of their tasks via a number of nodes,
/// whereas others (e.g.,
/// [`par_apply`](crate::traits::SequentialLabeling::par_apply)) via a
/// number of arcs. This enum allows to specify the granularity of parallel
/// tasks in a transparent way, by nodes or arcs. Conversion between the two
/// specifications is done by the methods
/// [`arc_granularity`](Self::arc_granularity) and
/// [`node_granularity`](Self::node_granularity).
